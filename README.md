## Quoth.Me
Quoth.Me is a social platform designed around personal quotes, and that's it.  
The goal is to create an over-the-top app that focuses on doing one core feature and doing it well.

This app is built with Rails 4 and PostGres. 

## Some desired features:

* Ridiculously beautiful quote pages.
* Mobile-first responsive interface
* Log in with [Mozilla Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/)
* User profiles
* Following and stream
* Thumbnails via [Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org/)
* The ability to share quotes to Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr
* Like and Bookmark other people's quotes
* quote tags for topics
* search quotes by author or topic
* OpenGraph tags on quote pages
* References (if a quote isn't yours, you can still submit it to the database and reference the original author)
* Author bots that sit in for authors of quotes that are deceased. They look like users, but no one can log in as them or claim their account. Instead, they just post referenced quotes that can be verified by someone.
